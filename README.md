# Synthetic Face Discriminitor

This is the code for our paper "Synthetic Face Discrimination via Learned Image Compression".
We distinguish synthetic face images from real ones by compressing the images - using the
variational autoencoder with a scale hyperprior model by Ball√© et al. and 2D-DWT as a 
pre-processing step.

The paper and more information will be uploaded soon.
